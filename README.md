# SOC--EdTech-Application
Seasons of Code Project 2025 by Manikarnika Sharma (24b0670)

During the project, we first did leetcode problems and watched lectures which helped me revise basic concepts of programming and apply them in Java. I found Java quite similar to C++ which we have learnt earlier so it was easy to catch up to it.

I installed and ran android studio, and started learning about different elements of app development, including activities, fragments, services.

As an assignment I built a To-Do application using Jetpack Compose, in this we used a TopAppBar as header and then an Outlined Text Field to enter the task followed by a row and column layout of tasks entered, with date of entering task displayed and a check box to toggle strike through. To delete a task, you can long press on it. The colours of the task container are random from a set list by using the time in miliseconds as a factor of indexing. This app used an mutable array list, which means that the memory was only uptil the moment the app was not exited.

I will move on the explore databasing and permanent memory.
